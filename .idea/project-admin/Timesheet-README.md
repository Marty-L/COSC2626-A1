# Notes on Timesheet.xlsx
## Project Management Effort-Logging Tool    

### IMPORTANT:
Please make sure that you edit/view/save _Timesheet.xlsx_ via Excel and **NOT** IntelliJ built-in editor. 

Failure to do so may cause the formatting/formulas to be damaged, as the built-in editor seems to want to treat this 
file as *.csv.

### Formula Tips:
* **Duration (hour)** column = **Time Out** - **Time In**
* Each week should end in a summary cell with **SUM(first entry:last entry)**
